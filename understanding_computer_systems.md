 # What is a hardware?
* **HARDWARE** is the equipment, or the physical devices, associated with a computer. For example, keyboards, mice, speakers, and printers are all hardware. 

 # What is a software?

  **SOFTWARE** 
  * is computer instructions that tell the hardware what to do. Software is programs, which are instruction sets written by programmers.

  NB When you write software instructions, you are **programming**.

 # Software can be classified into two broad types:
1.  **APPLICATION SOFTWARE**: comprises all the programs you apply to a task, such as word processing programs, spreadsheets, payroll and inventory programs, and even games.
2. **SYSTEM SOFTWARE**: comprises the programs that you use to manage your computer,including operating systems such as Windows, Linux, or UNIX

 # Together, computer hardware and software accomplish three major operations in most programs:
1. **Input** — Data items enter the computer system and are placed in memory, where they can be processed.
2. **Processing** — rocessing data items may involve organizing or sorting them, checking them for accuracy, or performing calculations with them. The hardware component that performs these types of tasks is the central processing unit, or CPU.
3. **Output** — After data items have been processed, the resulting information usually is sent to a printer, monitor, or some other output device so people can view, interpret, and use the results.   
  
  Programming professionals often use the term data for input items, but use the term information for data that has been processed and output

  The instructions you write using a programming language are called **program code;** when you write instructions, you are **coding the program.**

 # Every programming language has rules governing its word usage and punctuation. 
  *  These rules are called the **language’s syntax**. Mistakes in a language’s usage are **syntax errors**.

  **Programs** that are currently running and data items that are currently being used are stored in **RAM** for quick access

  **RAM**  Random access memory, or RAM, is a form of internal, volatile memory. Internal storage is **volatile** — its contents are lost when the computer is turned off or loses power.

 # Permanent storage devices 
  - are **nonvolatile** — that is, their contents are persistent and are retained even when power is lost.

  After a computer program is typed using programming language statements and stored in memory, it must be translated to **machine language** that represents the millions of **on/off** circuits within the computer.


- # Your programming language statements are called 
  **source code**. 
   ## translated machine language statements are 
   **object code**

  # Each programming language uses a piece of software,      

  called a **compiler** or an **interpreter**, to translate your source code into machine language. 

#### Machine language is also called 
  **binary language**,and is represented as a series of **0s and 1s**.
 - When you use a **compiler**, an *entire* program is translated before it can execute; when you use an **interpreter**, *each* instruction is translated just prior to execution. 

  # A program with no syntax errors is translatable and can execute, but it still might contain **logical errors** and produce incorrect output as a result.

  **NB** 
  - For a program to work properly, you must develop correct logic; that is, you must write program instructions in a specific sequence, you must not leave any instructions out, and you must not add extraneous instructions.

  ## Suppose you instruct someone to make a cake as follows:

  ```
      * Get a bowl
      * Stir
      * Add two eggs
      * Add a gallon of gasoline
      * Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes
      * Add three cups of flour
  ```

  **NB** Even though the cake-baking instructions use English language *syntax* correctly, the
  *instructions are out of sequence*, some are missing, and some instructions belong to
  procedures other than baking a cake.

  # A variable: 
    is a named memory location whose value can vary.

    The instruction set ```myAnswer = myNumber * 2``` is an example of a processing operation.
    In most programming languages, an asterisk is used to indicate multiplication, so this
    instruction means “Change the value of the memory location myAnswer to equal the value
    at the memory location myNumber times two.”

    # Memory location/ addresses
    Computer programmers often refer to memory addresses using hexadecimal notation, or *base 16.
    ```Eg.  42FF01A to refer to a memory address.```

  # program development cycle

        1. Understand the problem.
        2. Plan the logic.
        3. Code the program.
        4. Use software (a compiler or interpreter) to translate the program into machine language.
        5. Test the program.
        6. Put the program into production.
        7. Maintain the program
